# Introduction
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a two-player card game. In the game, players use a deck of 11 cards from A to J. The goal is to have a hand total that does not exceed 21 while trying to maximize it. Both players start with one face-down card and one face-up card, with the player able to view their own face-down card. During their turn, players can choose to Hit, Stay, or use items. Once both players choose to Stay, their hands are compared, and the winner is determined based on the higher hand total. The game ends after one round.
